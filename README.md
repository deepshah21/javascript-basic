## javascript object properties --> part2.js
    1. writable
    2. enumerable

    4. getters setters

## prototype and inheritance  --> part3.js
prototype is an object that exist in every function of javascript.
prototype is just an empty object.
_proto_ is property of all object in javascript

so function's prototype is the object instance that will become the prototype for all objects created using this function as a constructor.
instance from which the object is inherited.
